/* 
** This function is meant to:
** 1) Compute any movement
** 2) Send it to the bluetooth module.
**
** To make sure the measurements are meaningful,
** this code make 2 things :
** 1) Average the samples taken, AVERAGE_SAMPLE_NUMBER time
** 2) Apply a discrimination window, that every measurement
** comprised in a window going from WINDOW_LOW and WINDOW_HIGH
** is not considered a valid acceleration and is seen as accel = 0
**
** accel is an array len 2. Index 0 holds info about the previously
** measured accel. Index 1 about the current accel.
**
** velocity works on the same model
**
** It is this function's responsibility to :
** 1) At the end of processing, shift the current accel to the previous
** 2) Clean the space for the next measurement.
